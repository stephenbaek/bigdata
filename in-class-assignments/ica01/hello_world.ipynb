This means that every Python object is simply a cleverly-disguised C structure, which contains not only its value, but other information as well. For example, when we define an integer in Python, such as x = 10000, x is not just a \"raw\" integer. It's actually a pointer to a compound C structure, which contains several values. Looking through the Python 3.4 source code, we find that the integer (long) type definition effectively looks like this (once the C macros are expanded):\n",

All this additional information in Python types comes at a cost, however, which becomes especially apparent in structures that combine many of these objects."

    "But this flexibility comes at a cost: to allow these flexible types, each item in the list must contain its own type info, reference count, and other information–that is, each item is a complete Python object. In the special case that all variables are of the same type, much of this information is redundant: it can be much more efficient to store data in a fixed-type array, like what you would do (and are forced to do) in C. The difference between a dynamic-type list and a fixed-type array is illustrated in the following figure:\n",

The Python list, on the other hand, contains a pointer to a block of pointers, each of which in turn points to a full Python object like the Python integer we saw earlier. Again, the advantage of the list is flexibility: because each list element is a full structure containing both data and type information, the list can be filled with data of any desired type. Fixed-type arrays lack this flexibility, but are much more efficient for storing and manipulating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many data science applications, efficient storage and manipulation of numerical arrays is absolutely fundamental. For those applications, fixed-type arrays would be much more useful than dynamic-type lists, as all the elements we will be dealing with are essentially numbers. Furthermore, there are a lot of mathematical operations that we will need to apply to those numbers as we get to extract, transform, and analyze data. Unfortunately, the native Python does not have such capacity. Instead, there is a specialized toolset available for handling such numerical arrays, called the `NumPy` package and we will see this more in depth in the below section."
