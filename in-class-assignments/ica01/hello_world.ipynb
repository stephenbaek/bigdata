Looking through the Python 3.4 source code, we find that the integer (long) type definition effectively looks like this (once the C macros are expanded):\n","```cpp\n","struct _longobject {\n","    long ob_refcnt;\n","    PyTypeObject *ob_type;\n","    size_t ob_size;\n","    long ob_digit[1];\n","};\n","```\n","\n","A single integer in Python 3.4 actually contains four pieces:\n","\n","- `ob_refcnt`, a reference count that helps Python silently handle memory allocation and deallocation\n","- `ob_type`, which encodes the type of the variable\n","- `ob_size`, which specifies the size of the following data members\n","- `ob_digit`, which contains the actual integer value that we expect the Python variable to represent.\n","\n","\n","This means that there is some overhead in storing an integer in Python as compared to an integer in a compiled language like C, as illustrated in the following figure:\n","![C int vs Python int](https://github.com/stephenbaek/bigdata/blob/master/in-class-assignments/ica01/figures/cint_vs_pyint.png?raw=1)\n","\n","Here `PyObject_HEAD` is the part of the structure containing the reference count, type code, and other pieces mentioned before.\n","\n","Notice the difference here: a C integer is essentially a label for a position in memory whose bytes encode an integer value.

In the special case that all variables are of the same type, much of this information is redundant: it can be much more efficient to store data in a fixed-type array, like what you would do (and are forced to do) in C. The difference between a dynamic-type list and a fixed-type array is illustrated in the following figure:\n","\n","![Array vs List](https://github.com/stephenbaek/bigdata/blob/master/in-class-assignments/ica01/figures/array_vs_list.png?raw=1)\n","\n","The word 'Numpy' in the figure is something we will learn in a moment.

Again, the advantage of the list is flexibility: because each list element is a full structure containing both data and type information, the list can be filled with data of any desired type. Fixed-type arrays lack this flexibility, but are much more efficient for storing and manipulating data.\n","\n","In many data science applications, efficient storage and manipulation of numerical arrays is absolutely fundamental. For those applications, fixed-type arrays would be much more useful than dynamic-type lists, as all the elements we will be dealing with are essentially numbers. Furthermore, there are a lot of mathematical operations that we will need to apply to those numbers as we get to extract, transform, and analyze data.
