    "## 1. Introduction to Spark DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark SQL is a Spark module for structured data processing. The interfaces provided by Spark SQL provide Spark with more information about the structure of both the data and the computation being performed. Internally, Spark SQL uses this extra information to perform extra optimizations. There are several ways to interact with Spark SQL including SQL and the Dataset API. When computing a result, the same execution engine is used, independent of which API/language you are using to express the computation. This unification means that developers can easily switch back and forth between different APIs based on which provides the most natural way to express a given transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "One use of Spark SQL is to execute SQL queries. Spark SQL can also be used to read data from an existing Hive installation. For more on how to configure this feature, please refer to the Hive Tables section. When running SQL from within another programming language the results will be returned as a Dataset/DataFrame. You can also interact with the SQL interface using the command-line or over JDBC/ODBC.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Dataset** is a distributed collection of data. The Dataset API is available in Scala and Java. Python does not have the support for the Dataset API. But due to Python’s dynamic nature, many of the benefits of the Dataset API are already available (i.e. you can access the field of a row by name naturally row.columnName). A **DataFrame** is a Dataset organized into named columns. It is conceptually equivalent to a table in a relational database or a data frame in R/Python, but with richer optimizations under the hood. DataFrames can be constructed from a wide array of sources such as: structured data files, tables in Hive, external databases, or existing RDDs. The DataFrame API is available in Scala, Java, Python, and R.\n",

    "In PySpark, schema is a list of *column names*, *data types*, and *nullabilities*. A column name is literally just the name of a column and there's nothing to worry about. A data type indicates the type of values in the corresponding column and is typically one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- BooleanType – Boolean values.\n",
    "- IntegerType – An integer value. (i.e. a signed 32-bit integer)\n",
    "- FloatType - A single precision floating point number.\n",
    "- DoubleType – A floating-point double value.\n",
    "- StringType – A text string.\n",
    "- DateType – A datetime value. (datetime.date)\n",
    "- TimestampType – A timestamp value (typically in seconds from 1/1/1970).\n",
    "- NullType – The data type representing None, used for the types that cannot be inferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some situations, the following could also be used as a data type:\n",
    "- BinaryType – Binary (byte array) data.\n",
    "- ByteType – A byte value. (i.e. a signed integer in a single byte)\n",
    "- LongType – A long integer value.\n",
    "- ShortType – A short integer value.\n",
    "- DecimalType - A fixed precision value. DecimalType(5,2) means the maximum total number of digits is 5 and the number of digits after the decimal point (the dot) is 2. Therefore, numbers in the range $[-999.99, 999.99]$ can be represented with DecimalType(5,2).\n",

    "\n",
    "Lastly, the nullablility indicates wheather or not the column can contain `null` values. That is, if `nullable` is set to `True`, the column can contain `null` values in the entry. As a quick note, unless you have a full certainty about the data set, it's always better to set it to `True` to be safe because there can be `null` values almost always in real-world data sets (e.g. empty cells, missing values)."

    "As much you need to select columns, you will need to select rows too. However, selection of rows is not as trivial as in columns.

Furthermore, when your data is big, we are not talking about just a few handful number of rows, but thousands or millions of them (or even more).\n",

I have also mentioned that column objects are sort of like pointers or references to the corresponding column in the DataFrame.\n",

For example, a few lines ago, we saw that a boolean operation like this `(df['yearID'] >= 2015) & (df['HR'] > 20) & (df['SB'] > 20)` creates a column object like this `Column<b'(((yearID >= 2015) AND (HR > 20)) AND (SB > 20))>`.

It doesn't really run actual numerical operations at this point. So nothing is really added, multiplied, or compared. Instead, by the time the column object is pass along to a DataFrame method (e.g. `where()`, `withColumn()'), PySpark converts the query string into an optimized Spark code internally and executes the query.\n",

    "This is an important design principle of Spark you must understand. The choice behind this is actually quite obvious. It is obviously not a good idea to run calculations each time a user enters a code, because there can be so many data entries in a big data problem and the data are typically distributed across multiple DataNodes. Instead, it is more beneficial to collect all the queries until the end, and run only once when the user requests to fetch actual results. Further, when this happens, Spark optimizes the queries in a way that is compatible to the database system it is running on (in our case, Hadoop), which is a secret recipe behind efficient distributed computing."

In other words, the same player may have multiple rows of their record if they played more than one season. Now let's assume that we are interested in career homerun records (i.e. how many homeruns that a player has hit throughout the entire career), rather than season records. To do this, we need to be able to aggregate all the rows corresponding to each player by summing them up.\n",
