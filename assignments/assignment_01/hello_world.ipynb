    "This notebook is designed to provide a quick and dirty introduction to Python programming. If you are already familiar with Python programming, you can safely skip the sections below and jump directly to `assignment.ipynb` in the same folder with this one. This notebook is designed for complete newbies (=absolutely zero experience with Python) to help them quickly dive into the course materials for the rest of the course. This being said, it is NOT a purpose of this notebook to equip you with a comprehensive working knowledge and coding skills on Python. For more structured learning materials for Python, I strongly encourage you to purchase a book, take a (online) course, etc.\n",
