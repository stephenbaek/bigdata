If you are already familiar with Python programming, you can safely skip the sections below and jump directly to `assignment.ipynb` in the same folder with this one. This notebook is designed for complete newbies (=absolutely zero experience with Python) to help them quickly dive into the course materials for the rest of the course. This being said, it is NOT a purpose of this notebook to equip you with a comprehensive working knowledge and coding skills on Python. For more structured learning materials for Python, I strongly encourage you to purchase a book, take a (online) course, etc.\n",

It's actually a pretty cool way of doing note keeping on your experiments, as it allows you to put nicely formatted notes along with source codes executable on the fly. To get started, click the code below and hit `ctrl + enter` (or if you're using Mac, `cmd + enter`) and see what happens."

The one that you just ran is a cell containing a code and it's called a *code cell*. `ctrl + enter` (or `cmd + enter` for Mac) is usually how you run a code cell. Alternatively, you can hit `shift + enter`, which in this case, executes the code cell and move the focus to the next cell.\n",

    "There's another type of cell, which is a *text cell* or a *markdown cell*. The very paragraph that you are reading right now is actually a text cell. Text cells are for making notes to your codes essentially, but there can be a lot of different ways of using them. Text cells ues a text scripting language called 'Markdown'. Markdown is actually pretty simple to learn and for most of you, looking at [this cheat-sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) should be just enough. Below is an example of a text cell. Double click it and change some texts there."
